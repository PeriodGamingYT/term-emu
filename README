an incredibly basic terminal emulator, where it has the bare minimum 
implemented.

posix, unix, terminals, shells are all horrible, crufty, and just awful pieces
of garbage ever to be produced by humanity.

on a positive note, the silver lining of this project is now i know what kinds
of things i would need to solve if i were to make my own software stack from
scratch, and now im using the tigr library for graphics, instead of sdl.

sdl is okay, but it's massive, tigr isn't, and it does what i need so it ended
up being a better fit for me
